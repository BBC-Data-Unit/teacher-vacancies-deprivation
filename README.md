In September 2017 the BBC England Shared Data Unit [published a story showing that teacher vacancy rates are at their highest in primary schools in the most deprived parts of England](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40936182). This was the first story to come out of the data arm of the BBC Local News partnership.
